# SQLAlchemy Homework - Surfs Up!
-------------

This homework consisted of two parts:
1. Climate Analysis and Exploration
2. Step 2 - Climate App

Both of them are conteined in the github repository. The first one is in a jupyter notebook called Surfs Up!. The second part is a python file called app.py.

## 1. Climate Analysis and Exploration
In this section, we had to use SQLAlchemy to creat queries and find the correct results. 

### Precipitation Analysis
We began with the preparations needed to do this. We had to import the dependencies, create engines, use reflect to map the database After that, we began the analysis.
The first one was about precipitation, where we had to tackle the difficulties presented when one uses dates to filter, group or order by. Once the query wasa successfully created and answered, we had to graph the results by making them into a dataframe.

### Station Analysis
The station analysis also presented its difficulties. Here we had to use the function func to count the elements we had in a database, we also had to use sort to find the most active station. We also neede to use func.min, func.max and func.avg to fully describe the TOBS. Finally, we graph our results. 

## 2. Climate App
In this section, we moved to Visual Studio to work on apps and flasks. Here we had to create queries and routes that contained the results. The routes also needed to have "dynamic" to fully answer the queries.
